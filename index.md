# About Me

<img src="https://yuchencong.github.io/1_0155-1.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Chao Li (李超, )**.

I am currently an indefinite-term research scientist at RIKEN since 2021, working in the Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) together with Qibin Zhao. Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher with RIKEN-AIP from 2018 to 2020. I obtained the bachelor's and Ph. D. degrees at Harbin Engineering University (HEU) in China in 2006 and 2017, respectively. During the PhD, I worked as an international program associate (IPA) working with Prof. Andrzej Cichocki at RIKEN Brain Science Institute (BSI) from 2013 to 2015. My research interests include tensor networks, machine learning, neurosience . In five years, I published more than 10 academic papers in conferences and journals such as ICML, NeurIPS, CVPR, ECCV, AAAI, IEEE T-PAMI, IEEE T-NNLS, and IEEE T-IP. I regularly serves as a (senior) reviewer of ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI and IJCAI, and so on, and received the RIKEN Ohbu Research Incentive Award in 2020.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - chao.li [at] riken.jp


<!-- I am a graduate student in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, advised by [Prof. Özgür Akan](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/directory/akan), within [Internet of Everything (IoE) Group](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/). I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/). Prior to Cambridge,  I have worked on System Engineering, Cybersecurity and Wireless Communication with [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iZ7LQRkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://myuan27.github.io/). Recently, I was honored to be selected as **AAAI and SIGKDD Undergraduate Scholars**.
