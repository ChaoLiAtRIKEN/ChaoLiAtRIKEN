# 李超 (Chao LI, り チョウ)

*This page is still under development—apologies for the delay! Please feel free to contact me via email if you have any questions.*

I am currently an indefinite-term research scientist at [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp), working in the **Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP)** alongside Dr. [Qibin Zhao](https://qibinzhao.github.io) since 2021. Additionally, I am an affiliated researcher at the [Himeno-Sun Lab](https://himeno-sun-lab.github.io) at **Juntendo University**, one of Japan’s leading medical schools.

My research spans several interdisciplinary fields, including **tensor networks**, **machine learning (ML)**, **quantum computing**, and **computational neuroscience**, with a primary focus on advancing tensor network methodologies in the ML community.

As a scientist, I value publications as a critical avenue for contributing to the research community. My primary work has been featured in top computer science conferences, including:

- **ICML**
- **NeurIPS**
- **ICLR**
- **CVPR**
- **ECCV**
- **AISTATS**
- **AAAI**

I have also collaborated with many outstanding researchers, resulting in co-authored publications in high-impact journals such as:

- **IEEE T-PAMI**
- **TMLR**
- **IEEE T-NNLS**
- **IEEE T-IP**
- **Neural Networks**

I am actively involved in the academic community, regularly serving as a (senior) reviewer for prestigious conferences like ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI, and IJCAI. In recognition of my contributions, I received the **RIKEN Ohbu Research Incentive Award** in 2020.

If my research aligns with your interests, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at **chao.li [at] riken.jp**.

I am currently an indefinite-term research scientist at[RIKEN] (https://www.riken.jp) since 2021, working in the Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) together with Dr. [Qibin Zhao] (https://qibinzhao.github.io). I am also cocurrently a affilated researcher at [Himeno-Sun Lab] (https://himeno-sun-lab.github.io) of Juntendo university (Top medical school in Japan). In the recent years, my research interests involves various fields including tensor networks, machine learning (ML), quantum computing, and computional neurosience. However, my contribution is mainly on tensor networks in the ML society.

As a scientst, publications might be the most important contribution to the society. In past years, my major works are main published in conferences of computer science such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ECCV, AISTATS, AAAI. I have lots of colaboration with other execellent reseachers, with who I am luckily invovled as co-authors in journals such as IEEE T-PAMI, TMLR, T-NNLS, and T-IP. I regularly serves as a (senior) reviewer of ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI and IJCAI, and so on, and received the RIKEN Ohbu Research Incentive Award in 2020.

If you are interested in my reseearch, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - chao.li [at] riken.jp. -->


<!-- I am a graduate student in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, advised by [Prof. Özgür Akan](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/directory/akan), within [Internet of Everything (IoE) Group](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/). I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/). Prior to Cambridge,  I have worked on System Engineering, Cybersecurity and Wireless Communication with [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iZ7LQRkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://myuan27.github.io/). Recently, I was honored to be selected as **AAAI and SIGKDD Undergraduate Scholars**.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - hc663 [at] cam.ac.uk -->
